  "description": "Hydroinformatics is numbers \r\n   slowly dripping\r\n   down a pipeline\r\n             of vintage equations\r\n             explosive datasets\r\n             and exhaustive agendas,\r\n   wet with the sweat of \r\n   dedicated scientists\r\n   transient moments of clarity\r\n   and flowcharts.\r\n\r\nHydroinformatics is water converted\r\n   by our creativity and innovation\r\n   into a reservoir of 0's and 1's\r\n   assimilated into a pillow\r\n   that soften our edges with collaboration\r\n  and smooths our future consequences\r\n  with heroic feats of  knowledge building\r\n          on where the water has been\r\n          and where the water is going.",
